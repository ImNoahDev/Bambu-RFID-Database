# Bambu-RFID-Database

I aim to make this a database of all this different types of bambu labs rfid fillament tags so people can create copies of them to use on their 3rd party fillaments. If you want to contribute then you can upload copies of the tags that you have taken from your own fillaments do that other people can use them.
